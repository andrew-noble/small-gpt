# smallgpt

A very small language model I am training myself, based on a combination of smolGPT: https://github.com/Om-Alve/smolGPT and Karpathy's nanoGPT: https://github.com/karpathy/nanoGPT. This is essentially a long notes document where I'm learning the nitty gritty of GPT's.

The plan here is to train my first neural network from scratch to understand architechture.
